\chapter*{Preface}
The idea behind this book is to systematically put a lot of knowledge from different fields in the same place. It is envisioned to serve a purpose of an index book, a glossary introduction to modern physics. The depth may be lacking in some respects but the core idea is to have a background knowledge of many approaches and frameworks.
