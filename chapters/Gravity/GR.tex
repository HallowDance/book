\section{Anti De Sitter Space (AdS)}
$AdS_n$ is an $n$-dimensional solution for the theory of gravitation with Einstein-Hilbert action with negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$, i.e. the theory described by the following Lagrangian density:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{16\pi G_{(n)}}(R-2\Lambda),
\end{equation}
where $G_{(n)}$ is the gravitational constant in $n$-dimensional spacetime. Therefore, it's a solution of the Einstein field equations:
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 0,
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor and $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric of the spacetime. Introducing the radius $\alpha$ as 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda = \frac{-(n-1)(n-2)}{2\alpha^2}
\end{equation}
this solution can be immersed in a $n+1$ dimensional spacetime with signature $(-,-,+,\cdots,+)$ by the following constraint:
\begin{equation}
-X^2_1 - X^2_2 + \sum_{i=3}^{n+1}X_i^2 = -\alpha^2
\end{equation}
