\section{Basic Definitions}

\begin{definition}[(Group) Homomorphism]
Let $(G, *)$ and $(H,\cdot)$ be two groups. A (group) homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ is a function $h:G\rightarrow H$ such that for all $x,y$ in $G$ it holds that
$h(x*y) = h(u)\cdot h(v)$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Coset]
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. Consider an element $g \in G$. Then, $gH = \{ gh : h\in H\}$ is the \textit{left coset} of $H$ in $G$ with respect to $g$, and $Hg = \{hg : h\in H\}$ is the \textit{right coset} of $H$ in $G$ with respect to $g$
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
In general the left and right cosets are not groups.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Normal Subgroup]
A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is called \textit{normal} if and only if the left and right sets of cosets coincide, that is if $gH = Hg$ for all $g\in G$ 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Representation]
  A \textit{representation} of a group $G$ on a vector space $V$ over a filed
  $K$ is a group homomorphism from $G$ to $GL(V)$, the general linear group on
  $V$. That is, a representation is a map
  \begin{equation}
    \rho:G\rightarrow GL(V)
  \end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
  \rho(g_1g_2) = \rho(g_1)\rho(g_2), \quad \forall g_1,g_2 \in G.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

$V$ is often called the \textit{representation space} and the dimension of $V$
is called the \textit{dimension} of the representation. It is common practice
to refer to $V$ itself as the representation when the homomorphism is clear
from the context.

\begin{example}
  Consider the complex number $u = e^{2\pi/3}$ which has the property $u^3=1$.
  The cyclic group $C_3 = \{1,u,u^2\}$ has a representation $\rho$ on
  $\mathbb{C}^2$ given by:
  \begin{equation}
    \rho(1) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\quad 
    \rho(u) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & u\end{bmatrix},\quad
    \rho(u^2) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & u^2\end{bmatrix},\quad.
  \end{equation}
Another representation for $C_3$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$, isomorphic to the previous
one, is
  \begin{equation}
    \rho(1) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\quad 
    \rho(u) = \begin{bmatrix} u & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\quad
    \rho(u^2) = \begin{bmatrix} u^2 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\quad.
  \end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Subrepresentation]
  A subspace $W$ of $V$ that is invariant under the group action is called
  a subrepresentation.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[(Ir)reducible representation]
  If $V$ has exactly two representations, namely the zero-dimensional subspace
  and $V$ itself, then the representation is said to be \textit{irreducible};
  if it has a proper representation of nonzero dimension, the representation is
  said to be \textit{reducible}. The representation of dimension zero is
  considered to be neither reducible nor irreducible.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quotent Group]
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$. We define the set $G/N$ to be the set of all left cosets of $N$ in $G$, i.e., $G/N = \{aN:a\in G\}$. Define an operation on $G/N$ as follows. For each $aN$ and $bN$ in $G/N$, the product of $aN$ and $bN$ is $(aN)(bN)$. This defines an operation of $G/N$ if we impose $(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$, because $(ab)N$ does not depend on the choice of the representatives $a$ and $b$: if $xN=aN$ and $yN=bN$ for some $x,y \in G$, then:

(ab)N = a(bN) = a(yN) = a(Ny) = (aN)y = (xN)y = x(Ny) = x(yN) = (xy)N

Here it was used in an important way that $N$ is a normal subgroup. It can be shown that this operation on $G/N$ is associative, has identity element $N$ and the inverse of an element $aN \in G/N$ is $a^{-1}N$. Therefore, the set $G/N$ together with the defined operation forms a group; this is known as the \textit{quotient group} or \textit{factor group} of $G$ by $N$
\end{definition}
